 Java, the recommended programming language for the course, will be used
 for algorithm representation. The research utilizes Visual Studio Code as
 the IDE for Java code implementation. Some of the foundational code for
 this research is credited to the KTH course instructor [teacher]. The testing
 environment comprises a desktop PC powered by an Intel Core i7-13700k
 CPU. During testing, all extraneous system interactions, such as mouse
 movements or keyboard inputs, will be minimized. Additionally, background
 software will be terminated, and internet connections severed to ensure a
 controlled environment. Given the Intel Core i7-13700kâ€™s 16 cores and 24
 logical threads, most cores remain idle during testing, ensuring a stable and
 efficient runtime environment devoid of system interruptions
